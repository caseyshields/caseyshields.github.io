MCV-03 Light Tank
A transforming tank mech.
The MCV-03 is heavily armed and armored. Reactive armor plating and an autonomous turret defend the frame against rocket attacks. The main weapon is a light cannon which can acquire targets from the turret's sensors and employ accurate ballistic solutions.​

The model transforms between robot and vehicle mode without detatching any pieces. The vehicle structure is secured with some ill-fitting connections, so the seams are easy to locate, but durable enough to not come apart accidently.
 

The light tank mode rolls freely and both the turret and cannon are usable. Both weapons also attach at a single connector so they can be swapped out with your own replacements easily.

Despite the high degree of articulation, the model retains a very reasonable amount of stability. It has a low center of gravity and there is enough friction in the joints for the size (about 27 studs high).
It also has pretty good durability; the pin joints are reinforced with internal bars, and ball joints are sandwiched between plates. There is even some perpendicular building in the boots.
 

A dark bley color scheme was used since many of the joints are only available in this color. Hower the exterior pieces are mostly common plates, so accent colors and tiles are easy to swap in.
While compromises had to be made, effort was taken to make both modes as proportional and playable as simultaneously possible, while keeping the total number of parts and thier average cost low.
