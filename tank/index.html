      <span>The model is reasonably stable despite the high degree of articulation. The center of gravity is low and there is plenty of friction in the joints. To improve durability the pin joints are reinforced with internal bars, and ball joints are sandwiched between plates.</span>

      <span>The light tank mode rolls freely and both the turret and cannon are usable. Both weapons also attach at a single connector so they can be swapped out with replacements easily.</span>

      <span>Care was taken to make both modes as proportional and playable as simultaneously possible, while keeping the total number of parts and thier average cost low for brick link orders.</span>
