        <h3> Unlimited Origami </h3>
        <h4> Casey Shields - March 2018</h4>
        <p>Orsen Welles said “The enemy of art is the absence of limitations”. Origami must be fertile ground for art then, as origami models may only be folded from one paper square with no cuts or glue.</p>
        <p>Points and lines can be combined to make folds, and every fold produces new points in rough proportion to the number of folds made so far. This means that compared to the number of folds made, the number of possible subsequent folds grows roughly combinatorially, and the number of possible models grows exponentially to that.</p>
        <p>In other words, even with the strictest limitations, and the simplest primitives, we still approach infinite possibilities at a staggering pace. The rules do not actually limit us, but provide structure in the chaos of the uncountably infinite. As with all mature art forms, the limitations ultimately come to define the medium.</p>
        <p>But perhaps no where else is this fundamental truth so profoundly revealed as origami, because there are precious few art forms which are as precariously close to being just a solvable mathematical game.</p>
        <p>Consider chess; a beautiful and subtle game which computers have come to irretrievably dominate. In theory the 'correct chess strategy' could be computed just as it was for tic-tac-toe or Samuel's checkers. As things stand however, such a solution can't be found before the heat death of the universe. And to further complicate things, there likely isn't enough visible matter to write out the full proof.</p>
        <p>Origami searches are even more complex than this. There are more choices at each step, and the number of choices accelerates rather than slowing to a trickle. The similarities are limited of course; origami is not an adversarial search, and good chess moves are not subjective, they just have this uncomputable objective factor. But like chess, computers can make deep connections which we are simply incapable of.</p>
        <p>It is worth considering Robert Lang’s 'reference finder'. It is sometimes used by folders to find constructions for landmark points; points which describe fundamental ratios of the structure. These are important for all origami, especially half-angle or highly self-similar origami. In such models you often can't change the size of an ear without impacting every other proportion in the model. When every part simultaneously depends on each other, so you have no choice but to construct a solution for all those ratios.</p>
        <p>Reference Finder's main insight is because of how fast the possibilities grow in origami, any point on the paper within a few thousand parts error can be found in less than six moves using six axioms. This accuracy is well beyond what your hands can sense in any managably sized paper. This is an origami version of knowing a guy, who knows a guy, who knows a guy, who knows a guy, who knows a guy, who knows Kevin Bacon- or any other human being you care to name.</p>
        
        <p>With such startling results, one can almost imagine a brute program enumerating all possible origami forms from the graph of known geometries. This is certainly too far. Finding a predetermined ratio is one thing, Exhaustively searching for all origami is another. Modern models easily have hundreds of folds. A full origami search tree of that depth makes the chess problem look tiny- even using Claude Shannon's first rough estimate of the chess game tree of about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 game states.</p>
        
        <p>But that's not quite the end of it. We would need a good way to prioritize folds in the way chess programs prioritize moves. But how would yu write such a thing? How do we know a geometry is a figure? If every branch has no end, which one do we choose given finite memory? How do we know when we are done? As long as there is an uncomputable choice, the art will remain. And we use 'uncomputable' in the sense of theoretical computation, not as a reactionary Luddite!</p>
        
        <p>This is not to say Origami is totally free from the existential threat that mechanical reproduction poses to art. To navigate this huge search space folders have delevoped high level techniques to produce desired structures. There is no reason some of these cannot be automated.</p>
        <p>Folders have reacted to Lang's even more impressive 'TreeMaker' software in the way portraitists reacted to the Daguerreotype. And why not? given a stick figure of the proportions you want, treemaker uses a mathematical constraint solver to generate a crease pattern for the base of your desired model. Sure the folder might have to pleat sink some polygons, but where's the artistic skill and judgment?</p>
        <p>Advanced tools don't limit creativity, they simply let us see the problems we couldn't see before. What if I want to limit the number of allowed angles? What if I want to minimize work? What if I want to intersect a tesselation with certain faces of the model? What if the paper is non-planar? What's the best model for extreme materials, like cold worked sheet metal? How would you design a robot that could perform the folds?</p>
        
        Further more But in their defense, and by extension Art's defense;

        <p>The seeming mechanical simplicity of origami is likely the reason it has remained a toy or curiosity for the better part of its history. With the exception of highly sculpted models, all origami steps can be precisely described. The need for an ‘artistic touch’ is reduced to mere geometry.</p>
        <p>Though, perhaps the painter should not be too proud; today even the most sublime brushstroke is vectorized into a string of piece-wise, parametric, polynomial coefficients.</p>
        <p>At any rate, this crude heritage has advantages; Since the creation of a pictorial system of notations by Yoshizawa in 1954, it is possible to clearly document every choice the artist makes, in a totally language-independent way. This frees the art in a way uncommon outside of music; Any folder can almost flawlessly reproduce the art from a written description.</p>
        <p>This has ultimately made the origami community uniquely collaborative, globally reaching, as well as unbound from any economics of scarcity. You simply need a limber mind and good instructions.</p>
        <p>In this way you can imagine the community of folders as a complex ecosystem of algorithms. Like networked computers computers generating, sending, linking, and executing code for web pages. Or like the cellular machinery transcribing chains of DNA to RNA to collapsible amino acids in every one of our hundred trillion cells.</p>
        <p>Looking at origami in such a detached way is surely a disservice. After all, programs and proteins require cutting and gluing. Obviously they are of a less pure and refined art form! But then where is the actual art in origami?</p>
        <p>Is it only the final folded form, or is it waiting in the paper like David in marble?</p>
        <p>Is it in the pile of malformed and discarded studies, which had to be made before the right solution was found? Or is a new artwork just some search path protruding from the perimeter of the graph of known geometries?</p>
        <p>Is the art actually in the discovery of geometrical constructions which allow the finding of new path? Or is in the skillful wielding of such techniques that allow the construction of never before seen meta-forms?</p>
        <p>A true uniqueness of origami is it is transformative. Folding neither adds nor subtracts. We end with the same amount of stuff we started with. Is it then possible to truly appreciate the model and crease pattern separately? After all, they are simply transient points in a continuous transformation. Is the transformation the art?</p>
        <p>If so, then the physical artifact must be the instructions- amusingly, The only paper we don't fold. However, instructions hardly capture the full nuance. Even the final diagrams are just one sequence among many hidden paths. In highly self-similar origami, there are countless alternate paths with trade-offs in clarity, work and accuracy. Which one should the artist value?</p>
        <p>For all these questions, I'm not particularly convinced one way of the other. I've seen too many other schools, with entirely different conclusions, which still posses the gravity of art to me.</p>
        <p>What I do know is the joy of origami comes from meditating on an inexhaustible number of changing forms, while only being allowed to do hardly anything, upon almost nothing.</p>
